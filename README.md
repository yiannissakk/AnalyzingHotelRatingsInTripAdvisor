# AnalyzingHotelRatingsInTripAdvisor

Web Scraping, Linear and Logistic Regression Analysis of Boston Hotels in Python. TripAdvisor asks, its reviewers to rate a hotel based on specific attributes as well as to give an overall score for their stay. I scraped all review ratings and tried to find good predictors for the total score of a hotel (Linear Regression). Also, classified hotels as Excellent or not (Logistic Regression).
