# AnalyzingHotelRatingsInTripAdvisor

This is an analysis of Tripadvisor hotel reviews. TripAdvisor asks its hotel reviewers to rate a hotel based on specific attributes as well as to give an overall score for their stay. This analysis showcases which of these attributes play an important role in determining the overall rating of the hotel given also by the user(s).

I web scraped all review ratings and found which of the attributes are good predictors for the total score of a hotel (Linear Regression). I also classified hotels as Excellent or not (Logistic Regression).
